Accurate positioning at any time be well known by a master strategist, sometimes be not stingy either as “To take a step back to gain more” gambit which as been a religious ritual by sb-self. Devout in Providence, but not provident upon certain pieces of cloud's piety which up-above, perhaps such kind of attitude towards life be deeply ingrained among human minds. Whether the snowball can continuously rolling, which depends on whether deep winter or warm spring as the snowball toward to._

At the heart of Warren Buffett’s 2025 shareholder meeting lies a paradox: a man who built an empire worth $100 billion by embracing simplicity, patience, and moral clarity in a world increasingly defined by chaos. His philosophy, encapsulated in the metaphor of the snowball—a symbol of compounding returns and long-term vision—transcends mere business strategy. It is a moral compass, guiding us through the tempests of greed and fear, and redefining success as a harmony between rationality and ethical responsibility.

### **1. The Snowball’s Dual Nature: Rationality and Restraint**

Buffett’s snowball metaphor, popularized in his autobiography _The Snowball_, reflects two intertwined principles: **compound interest** and **the power of patience**. Yet, its deeper resonance lies in its moral dimension. To let the snowball grow, one must resist the urge to disrupt its momentum—whether by chasing fleeting trends or succumbing to panic. This requires not just financial discipline but a moral commitment to _delayed gratification_.

At the 2025 meeting, Buffett emphasized that _“logic doesn’t slap you in the face, but emotions do.”_ He warned against the “perpetual motion machine” of short-term trading, where fear and greed become self-fulfilling prophecies. Instead, he advocated for a stoic detachment, akin to a monk’s devotion to their faith. This is not 冷漠 (indifference) but a calculated embrace of **emotional austerity**—a refusal to let market noise drown out the quiet voice of reason.

### **2. The Moral Imperative of Long-Termism**

For Buffett, long-termism is not a business tactic but a moral stance. He rejects the notion that capitalism must prioritize immediate gains over ethical integrity. His 50-year commitment to Japanese conglomerates like Mitsubishi and Mitsui, for instance, is rooted in a belief that trust and stability outweigh short-term profits. As he noted at the meeting, _“A company’s culture is its 护城河 (moat). If you destroy it for a quarterly report, you’ve lost more than money—you’ve lost your soul.”_

This philosophy aligns with Confucian principles of _ren_ (仁，benevolence) and _yi_ (义，righteousness). Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, with its emphasis on employee well-being and community impact, embodies a capitalism that views profit as a byproduct of ethical conduct, not an end in itself.

### **3. The Virtue of “Strategic Retreat”**

The opening line’s reference to _“taking a step back to gain more”_ echoes Buffett’s infamous cash reserves—$347 billion in 2025, a war chest he refuses to deploy recklessly. This is not cowardice but a moral choice. By waiting for undervalued opportunities, Buffett avoids contributing to market bubbles, thereby protecting the savings of ordinary investors. As he quipped, _“If you’re not willing to hold a stock for 10 years, don’t hold it for 10 minutes.”_

This restraint mirrors the Taoist concept of _wu wei_ (无为，non-action), where true power lies in strategic inaction. Buffett’s “religious ritual” of patience is a rejection of the hyperactive, transactional mindset that plagues modern finance—a stance that, paradoxically, yields greater rewards over time.

### **4. The Snowball’s Inevitable Test: Winter or Spring?**

The metaphor of the snowball’s journey—_“whether deep winter or warm spring”_—speaks to Buffett’s cyclical view of markets. He does not fear market downturns; he prepares for them. His 2008 investment in Goldman Sachs during the financial crisis, or his recent $5 billion bet on Occidental Petroleum, exemplify this philosophy: _“Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”_

But this is more than a contrarian strategy. It is a moral reckoning. When the “tide recedes,” as Buffett famously warned, those who prioritized short-term gains over sustainability are exposed. His snowball, forged in the crucible of discipline, survives because it is built on **enduring values**, not ephemeral trends.

### **5. The Moral Legacy of a “Cold-Hearted” Optimist**

Buffett’s “冷静、疏离、效率至上” (calm, detached, efficiency-obsessed) persona masks a profound optimism. He believes in the power of human ingenuity and systemic resilience, yet he tempers this with a realistic appraisal of risk. His decision to step down as CEO in 2025, handing the reins to Greg Abel, is a testament to this balance: _“The game doesn’t change, but the players do. What matters is the legacy we leave behind.”_

This legacy is not just financial. It is a blueprint for ethical capitalism—one where rationality and morality are not opposing forces but complementary virtues. As Buffett concluded at the meeting, _“The best investment you can make is in yourself… and in the world you want to live in.”_

### **Conclusion: The Snowball’s Eternal Lesson**

Warren Buffett’s snowball is more than a financial metaphor. It is a moral allegory for our time. In an era of instant gratification and algorithm-driven chaos, his philosophy reminds us that true wealth—financial, intellectual, and ethical—is built not through speed, but through patience, integrity, and a steadfast commitment to principles.

As the snowball rolls on, it leaves behind a trail of wisdom: **that which is slow, steady, and rooted in virtue will outlast the storms of greed and fear**. And in this, Buffett’s legacy transcends commerce—it becomes a universal truth, inscribed in the very fabric of human progress.

Who am i?
------
I'm an undergraduate student major in IE (Information Engineering) from the [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interests include Multi-Modal Reasoning and Planning with (Multi-Modal) Large Language Models (e.g., LLM, VLM, VLA, VLN, etc.), Generalized Reasoning.

## About Me


### A Journey of Curiosity and Passion

Hello! I'm an enthusiastic learner and researcher who believes that a fulfilling life is built on diverse passions and experiences. My academic journey is driven by a fascination with technology, and my research projects are a constant playground for innovative ideas. But there's more to me than just algorithms and data — I celebrate life through a multitude of interests.

## Embracing Life in All Its Dimensions

When I'm not delving into complex research topics, I dive into a vibrant world of creativity and movement:

- **Sports & Fitness:** I keep my mind sharp and my body energized with regular workouts and long-distance runs. The rhythm of physical activity inspires fresh perspectives and fuels my daily productivity.
- **Photography:** Capturing the beauty of everyday moments through the lens is my way of storytelling. Photography helps me frame the world in new ways and appreciate the art of detail.
- **Music:** Whether it’s exploring new genres or revisiting timeless classics, music is my constant companion. It’s the background score that both relaxes and energizes me.
- **Literature:** I find solace and inspiration in literature. Reading broadens my horizons and enriches my understanding of the human experience, sparking ideas that often influence my technical projects.

### Academic & Research Endeavors

My research work is not just about solving problems — it's a voyage of discovery. I'm actively involved in projects that push the boundaries of:

- **Neural Networks & Generalized Reasoning:** Exploring models that mirror the adaptability of natural intelligence.
- **Multimodal Models:** Integrating information across different data streams to develop more comprehensive solutions.

I thrive on collaborating with diverse minds and leveraging interdisciplinary approaches to drive meaningful scientific and technological advancements.

### A Space to Connect

This digital space serves as both a personal journal and a resource hub where I share:
- Detailed insights from my research journey.
- Reflections on life through the lens of art, music, photography, and literature.
- Practical projects and code samples that you can explore on my GitHub pages.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts, exchange ideas, and explore new opportunities for collaboration. If you share a passion for curiosity, innovation, and a well-rounded life, feel free to reach out!

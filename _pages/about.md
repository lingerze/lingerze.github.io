Who am i?
------
I'm an undergraduate student major in IE (Information Engineering) from the [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). My research interests include Neural Networks, Generalized Reasoning, and Multimodal Models.

## About Me

### A Journey of Curiosity and Passion

Hello! I'm an enthusiastic learner and researcher who believes that a fulfilling life is built on diverse passions and experiences. My academic journey is driven by a fascination with technology, and my research projects are a constant playground for innovative ideas. But there's more to me than just algorithms and data — I celebrate life through a multitude of interests.

## Embracing Life in All Its Dimensions

When I'm not delving into complex research topics, I dive into a vibrant world of creativity and movement:

- **Sports & Fitness:** I keep my mind sharp and my body energized with regular workouts and long-distance runs. The rhythm of physical activity inspires fresh perspectives and fuels my daily productivity.
- **Photography:** Capturing the beauty of everyday moments through the lens is my way of storytelling. Photography helps me frame the world in new ways and appreciate the art of detail.
- **Music:** Whether it’s exploring new genres or revisiting timeless classics, music is my constant companion. It’s the background score that both relaxes and energizes me.
- **Literature:** I find solace and inspiration in literature. Reading broadens my horizons and enriches my understanding of the human experience, sparking ideas that often influence my technical projects.

### Academic & Research Endeavors

My research work is not just about solving problems — it's a voyage of discovery. I'm actively involved in projects that push the boundaries of:

- **Neural Networks & Generalized Reasoning:** Exploring models that mirror the adaptability of natural intelligence.
- **Multimodal Models:** Integrating information across different data streams to develop more comprehensive solutions.

I thrive on collaborating with diverse minds and leveraging interdisciplinary approaches to drive meaningful scientific and technological advancements.

### A Space to Connect

This digital space serves as both a personal journal and a resource hub where I share:
- Detailed insights from my research journey.
- Reflections on life through the lens of art, music, photography, and literature.
- Practical projects and code samples that you can explore on my GitHub pages.

I'm always excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts, exchange ideas, and explore new opportunities for collaboration. If you share a passion for curiosity, innovation, and a well-rounded life, feel free to reach out!

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
